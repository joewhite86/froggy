Frogr - RESTful Graphdatabase Java framework
============================================

**Frogr is a Java framework for developing high-performance RESTful web services.**

With **Frogr** you can get a service up and running in minutes, but thereâ€™s no limit in complexity. 
**Frogr** uses a *repository pattern* for seperating data, business logic and external interfaces. 
This approach makes it easy to test and extend your code.

**Frogr** packs multiple stable libraries into an easy to use, light-weight framework, 
so you won't have tons of additional dependencies, you probably never will need.
