Quickstart
==========

First, add the dependency to your project.

Maven
-----

.. code-block:: xml

  <dependency>
      <groupId>de.whitefrog</groupId>
      <artifactId>frogr-base</artifactId>
      <version>0.1.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>

Application
-----------

Next we will create the main entry point for the service.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basic/src/main/java/de/whitefrog/frogr/example/MyApplication.java
  :language: java
  :lines: 6-

As you can see there are two registry calls in the application's constructor.
``register(...)`` let's the application know in which package to look for rest classes.
``serviceInjector().service().register(...)`` tells the application where to look for models and repositories.
More information about the Application entry point: :doc:`Application <documentation/application>`

Configs
-------

You may also have noticed there's a config file used in the main method.
This is required to setup our Dropwizard_ instance, so we have to create that one now. 
There's a second config file needed, which configures our embedded Neo4j_ instance.
By default these configs should be in your project in a directory 'config'.

``config/example.yml``

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basic/config/example.yml
  :language: yaml

Reference: `Dropwizard Configuration`_

``config/neo4j.properties``

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basic/config/neo4j.properties
  :language: properties

Reference: `Neo4j Configuration`_

RelationshipTypes
-----------------

We should add a class that holds our relationship types, so that we have consistent and convienient access.
This is not a requirement but I highly recommend it. Doing so we don't have to deal with string in Java code, which is never a good choice, right?

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basic/src/main/java/de/whitefrog/frogr/example/RelationshipTypes.java
  :language: java
  :lines: 5-

Model
-----

Now, let's create a :doc:`model <documentation/models>`. I recommend using Kotlin_ for that.
All models have to extend the Entity class or implement the Model interface at least.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basic/src/main/java/de/whitefrog/frogr/example/model/Person.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :lines: 9-

As you can see, we used the relationship types created before, to declare our relationships to other models.

Repository
----------

Normally we would create a repository for persons. But we won't need extra methods for
this tutorial and frogr will create a default repository if it can't find one.
If you need more information visit :doc:`documentation/repositories`.

Service
-------

Next we'll have to create the REST :doc:`service <documentation/services>` layer. There's a base class, that provides
basic CRUD operations, so you only have to add methods for special cases. Of course you
can also use any other JAX-RS annotated class.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basic/src/main/java/de/whitefrog/frogr/example/rest/Persons.java
  :language: java
  :lines: 14-26,35
